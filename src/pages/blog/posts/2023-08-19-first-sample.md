Building your own blogging platform is no small feat. From picking the stack you want to use, along with CSS solutions, to how you're going to organize your content are all the decisions that you have to make. I have gone down this path a few times with my own blog built with just Angular, and Angular and Scully, and hosted solutions like Dev.to. I continue to want something with low-friction so that I could get my thoughts out and be able to write blog posts more quickly about things that I've learned along the way or things that I'm tinkering with. This post is how I started on a different path, ended up rebuilding my blog and became an Astronaut ðŸš€.

TL;DR - [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/vathsa-hebbar/astro-blog) for my blog rebuilt with Astro.
